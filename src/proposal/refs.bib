	abstract = {Continuous Integration (CI) has become a disruptive innovation in software development: with proper tool support and adoption, positive effects have been demonstrated for pull request throughput and scaling up of project sizes. As any other innovation, adopting CI implies adapting existing practices in order to take full advantage of its potential, and "best practices" to that end have been proposed. Here we study the adaptation and evolution of code writing and submission, issue and pull request closing, and testing practices as Travis CI is adopted by hundreds of established projects on GitHub. To help essentialize the quantitative results, we also survey a sample of GITHUB developers about their experiences with adopting Travis CI. Our findings suggest a more nuanced picture of how GitHub teams are adapting to, and benefiting from, continuous integration technology than suggested by prior work.},

	abstract = {This session reflects R\&D on User Centered Design and Development and User Participation (in short UCD in the following) for/with people with disabilities. Better guidelines, methods, techniques and tools are needed to improve the quality of R\&D and practice both in the domain of Assistive Technology (AT), eAccessibility and eInclusion itself but also for improving the quality of mainstream R\&D through UCD and participation of people with disabilities. We analyze the state of the art, identify gaps and problems as well as discuss examples and new approaches presented in 5 papers. The introduction integrates the topic into the broader context of UCD in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) playing a major role for AT, eAccessibility and digital inclusion. We underline the need for ongoing and more intense R\&D on UCD to improve quality and usability. By promoting this session in the ICCHP conference series we aim at establishing a comprehensive point of access to scientific work in this domain.},

To this regard, automatic evaluation and monitoring of Web accessibility can play a key role for various stakeholders involved in creating and maintaining over time accessible products. In this paper we present the results of elicitation activities that we carried out in a European project to collect experience and feedback from Web commissioners, developers and content authors of websites and web applications. The purpose was to understand their current practices in addressing accessibility issues, identify the barriers they encounter when exploiting automatic support in ensuring the accessibility of Web resources, and receive indications about what functionalities they would like to exploit in order to better manage accessibility evaluation and monitoring.},
